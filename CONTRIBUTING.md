# Contributing to Endless Host Roles (EHR)

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We appreciate any help, whether it's fixing bugs, improving features, or enhancing documentation.  

Please read through these guidelines before submitting your contributions.

---

## 1. Getting in Touch

If you have questions, ideas, or want to discuss changes before submitting them, reach out through the **[EHR Discord server](https://discord.gg/ehr)**.  

You don’t need to get approval for every small fix or improvement, as long as the changes are sensible and helpful to the project.

---

## 2. Workflow

- This project uses a **single branch** (usually `main`).  
- Pull Requests (PRs) should **squash commits** before merging.  
- Linking PRs to issues is **not required**.  
- Before making major changes to core features, please check with the community or ask in Discord to ensure it’s wanted.

---

## 3. Coding Guidelines

- Follow the **existing code style**.  
- JetBrains Rider is recommended, as the editor settings are included in the repo, so they will sync automatically if used by contributors.  
- Make sure your changes are consistent with the surrounding code.  

---

## 4. Issues & Bug Reports

- There’s no formal requirement to create issues.  
- If you notice something that doesn’t work or can be improved and you know how to fix it, feel free to make a PR directly.  
- For discussion or questions, the **Discord server** is preferred over GitHub issues.

---

## 5. Reviewing & Merging

- All PRs are **reviewed personally** by the project maintainer.  
- No automated approval or checks are required; every decision is made manually.  
- Ensure your PR is **well-documented**, and any changes are clear in the description.

---

## 6. Special Notes

- Before modifying **major features**, check with the community or confirm that your change is desirable.  
- Contributions to documentation, translations, or examples are always welcome!
