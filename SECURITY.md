# Security Policy for Endless Host Roles (EHR)

Ensuring the security of our community and mod is a top priority. This document explains how to responsibly report security issues and what to expect.

---

## 1. Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in EHR (either in-game exploits or issues in the mod code), please report it **privately** through the **[EHR Discord server](https://discord.gg/ehr)** by opening a support ticket.

**Include as much information as possible:**

- Steps to reproduce the issue  
- Video footage or screenshots demonstrating the problem  
- Logs from the mod (`log.html`, `LogOutput.log`, `Errorlog.log`)

Providing all three is ideal to help us understand and fix the issue quickly.

---

## 2. Response Time

We aim to respond to all security reports **within the same day** whenever possible.

---

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to:

- In-game exploits or bugs that could be abused  
- Mod code vulnerabilities that could affect users or the community  

---

## 4. Disclosure

- Please **do not publicly disclose** any vulnerabilities until a fix has been released.  
- We will work to release a patch as soon as possible to resolve reported issues.

Thank you for helping us keep EHR safe and fair for all players. 💜
