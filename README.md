## Should I switch from TOHE to EHR?

- In comparison, both mods are great, but EHR has more roles, features, game modes, and settings.
- Moreover, EHR contains almost all the roles from TOHE, so you won't be missing out on anything.
- Some roles were deleted or reworked to make them more balanced or to make them fit better with the new roles.
- If you switch to EHR, you will have access to all features without paying for anything.
- Test builds are available for free in our Discord server, and you can report bugs and suggest features there as well.
- /up was reworked to /setrole, allowing you to set anyone's role for the next game, not only yours.
- You can fully gain access to /setrole by just hosting EHR lobbies weekly or uploading EHR content to YouTube, but
  everyone can use /setrole to set their own role without any requirements (essentially /up).
- EHR has a custom team assigner application, which is a unique feature that no other mod has.
- You can force or ban certain role/add-on combinations directly in the game using /combo.
- Not sure how to use commands? Use /help to see a list of all available commands.
- EHR helps the host use commands by directly displaying their short descriptions, arguments, descriptions for all
  arguments, and checking whether an argument is valid or not.
- You can also press TAB to autocomplete commands.
- Some hints and tips are displayed during the loading screen and ejection animations, which can help you discover new
  features.
- EHR has 10 unique custom game modes, which can be played with any number of players, some even alone.
- You can make lobbies with more than 15 players on modded servers, just type /cs players 100 - for example - to set the
  player limit to 100.
- I, the main developer of EHR, care about user feedback and suggestions, and I try to implement them as much as
  possible.
- If this wasn't convincing enough, you can always try EHR and see if you like it better than TOHE.
- In the end, it's your choice, and I respect it.

# Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy for EHR Lobby Sharing

**Effective Date:** 2025-01-05

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 1. **Introduction**

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and handle information related to lobby sharing via the EHR Website
for your Among Us mod. We are committed to ensuring that your data privacy and security are respected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 2. **Information Collected**
When using this integration, we collect the following non-personal information:

- **Lobby Code:** A six-letter code that uniquely identifies a game lobby.
- **Server Name:** The region where the game server is hosted (e.g., Asia, EU, NA).
- **User Language:** The selected language for the game (e.g., English, Russian, Spanish).
- **Mod Version:** The version of the Endless Host Roles (EHR) mod being used.
- **Lobby Status:** The current status of the lobby (e.g., In Lobby, In Game, Ended).

Furthermore, the following information is collected to enhance the user experience:

- **Completed Achievements:** A list of custom achievements (added by the mod) completed by the user, in the form of
  numbers. (Please note that the users are identified using their encrypted product user ID, not their username or any
  other personal information. This ID is unique to each user and is not shared with any third parties. This ID cannot be
  used to identify the user outside the game.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 3. **How Information is Used**
The collected information is used solely for the following purposes:

- To notify players about available lobbies via the designated Discord server.
- To update the status of the lobby in real time, enhancing coordination among players.
- To ensure, that progress in custom achievements isn't lost when updating or reinstalling the mod.

**No personal data** or any other information beyond what is listed above is collected or processed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 4. **Data Sharing**

- The collected information is only sent to the EHR Website through an API.
- No data is shared with third parties or used for any other purposes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 5. **User Control and Opt-Out**

You have full control over whether to enable or disable data sharing. You can disable lobby sharing by:

1. Opening the **Room Settings** UI.
2. Navigating to the **System Settings** tab.
3. Turning off the setting labeled **Post the lobby code to the EHR Website**.

When disabled, no lobby information will be collected or transmitted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 6. **Data Retention**

- Lobby data is retained only as long as the lobby is active. Once a lobby is closed, the data is removed from our
  system within 3 minutes.
- We do not store historical records of lobbies after they are removed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 7. **Changes to this Privacy Policy**
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be communicated through an update in the mod or via the official EHR Discord channel.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 8. **Contact Us**
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how your data is handled, please contact us at:

**[The EHR Discord Server](https://discord.gg/m3ayxfumC8)**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By using the Endless Host Roles mod, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.
