## Main Features

- Note: The goal with this branch is to improve the existing stuff over adding new roles. If some of the stuff you see
  below are in other mods, they were originally coded by me.

### Most Popular Game Mode

- A brand-new official gamemode, Basic FFA (Free For All)
- This mode makes everyone a killer and the last player alive wins
- Features: Random events, ranks and scoring, random ability gain for every kill, game timer, scoreboard (task list),
  unique end screen, fully customizable

### Overall improvements compared to other mods

- Role spawn chances are in percentages
- Gain more ability uses for completing tasks as crewmate roles
- Gain more ability uses for getting kills as impostor roles
- Most shapeshifting roles that only used shapeshifting as an ability trigger or a target selector now don't actually
  shapeshift with the egg animation, it's automatically canceled
- Prevent kills while shifted when no ability uses are left for some roles (Sniper, Twister, Disperser, Hangman,
  Camouflager, etc.)
- Code cleanup and major performance improvement
- Improved EAC
- Better intro sounds
- Better custom button images
- Better progress text look
- Visualized cooldowns for more roles
- Disabled most shield animations for modded clients for a better experience, and even some for vanilla clients (all
  cooldowns are still reset properly, this is just a visual improvement)
- Shapeshift and vent cooldowns are now always reset after meetings
- Custom main menu
- Improved strings and their appearance
- More customizable settings; More reasonable default settings
- Starting Kill Cooldown setting
- Better confirm ejections text
- Brand-new HUD text
- Better role summary
- Option to use Pet button instead of Vent, Shapeshift or Sabotage (assigns the Pusheen pet to everyone at the start of
  the game)
- Smaller mod version text and smaller credentials text (imo it was annoying that it covered a quarter of the screen)
- Players have their name displayed with their color on the ejection screen
- How many killers remain after each ejection (even if no one was ejected, like it was a skip or a tie) is displayed
  below everyone's name
- You can chat during the game if the game mode is FFA
- Simplified and shortened role descriptions
- Loading animation
- Set anyone's role for the next game using '/setrole [player ID] [role name]' (replaces /up)

### Role specific Improvements

#### Crewmates

- Chameleon uses vanilla engineer cooldown
- The target of the Deputy no longer gets a shield animation on top of the Deputy
- Fortune Teller: Setting whether it shows specific roles after completing tasks
- Merchant: Option to sell Balanced add-ons (based on my opinion)
- Mortician: Setting whether it has arrows toward dead bodies
- Oracle: Chance to show incorrect results
- Mechanic: Settings that determine how many uses it takes to fix Lights/Comms and Reactor/O2
- Sheriff: Setting whether to display the shot limit next to the role name
- Tracefinder: Settings that determine the delay in which the arrows show up
- Bodyguard: Setting whether the murderer dies when the bodyguard protects the target
- Monarch: Can be guessed, just not by Knighted players

#### Impostors

- Ninja: Kill Cooldown no longer resets when unshifting
- Bounty Hunter: Target's name is displayed in black for the Bounty Hunter; Swap Timer is displayed next to the role
  name, not on the Shapeshift button => Changed the basis to regular Impostor
- Eraser: Erase by Voting or by Kill Button & What to do when target is neutral
- Hangman: Kill Cooldown after strangling
- Mare (add-on): Can kill at all times, but if lights are not out, the kill cooldown is higher
- Quick Shooter now works correctly
- Serial Killer: Suicide Timer is displayed next to the role name, not on the Shapeshift button => Changed the basis to
  regular Impostor; Setting whether the Suicide Timer only starts after their first kill
- Swooper: Setting whether it can vent normally when swooping is on cooldown; Swoop Cooldown is visualized next to the
  role name
- Wildling: Setting whether the role can Shapeshift or not; Setting whether the role can Vent or not
- Underdog: Can kill at all times, but if the number of players alive is higher than the set amount, the kill cooldown
  is higher
- Miner: Shapeshift Cooldown and Shapeshift Duration setting
- Escapist: Shapeshift Cooldown and Shapeshift Duration setting
- Cleaner: Can only clean bodies if their kill cooldown is up
- Vampire: Kill Cooldown is reset when the bitten target dies
- Capitalist: Can kill normally with the double click method (& + Kill Cooldown setting)
- Killing Machine: Has impostor vision
- Puppeteer: Added a lot of settings

#### Neutrals

- Medusa: Can only clean bodies if their kill cooldown is up
- Wraith: Setting whether it can vent normally when invis is on cooldown; Invis Cooldown is visualized next to the role
  name
- Poisoner: Kill Cooldown is reset when the poisoned target dies
- Glitch is now The Glitch from TOU-R, it was completely rewritten, and I worked really hard on it
- Provocateur: No longer suicides after selecting a target
- Pursuer: Target doesn't die when trying to use their kill button, they'll just have their kill cooldown reset
