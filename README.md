## Should I switch from TOHE to EHR?

- In comparison, both mods are great, but EHR has more roles, features, game modes, and settings.
- Moreover, EHR contains almost all the roles from TOHE, so you won't be missing out on anything.
- Some roles were deleted or reworked to make them more balanced or to make them fit better with the new roles.
- If you switch to EHR, you will have access to all features without paying for anything.
- Test builds are available for free in our Discord server, and you can report bugs and suggest features there as well.
- /up was reworked to /setrole, allowing you to set anyone's role for the next game, not only yours.
- You can gain access to /setrole by just hosting EHR lobbies weekly or uploading EHR content to YouTube.
- EHR has a custom team assigner application, which is a unique feature that no other mod has.
- You can force or ban certain role/add-on combinations directly in the game using /combo.
- Not sure how to use commands? Use /help to see a list of all available commands.
- EHR helps the host use commands by directly displaying their short descriptions, arguments, descriptions for all
  arguments, and checking whether an argument is valid or not.
- You can also press TAB to autocomplete commands.
- Some hints and tips are displayed during the loading screen and ejection animations, which can help you discover new
  features.
- I, the main developer of EHR, care about user feedback and suggestions, and I try to implement them as much as
  possible.
- If this wasn't convincing enough, you can always try EHR and see if you like it better than TOHE.
- In the end, it's your choice, and I respect it.
