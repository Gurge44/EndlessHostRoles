## Thank you for using EHR!

## Urgent announcement and warning
- With Map 5, The Fungle right around the corner, be sure to make a copy of your current Among Us installation, or you will not be able to play with mods, guaranteed.
- I will try my hardest to make EHR compatible with the new game version (even if not with the new map yet), but it will take time, and I also want to help TOHEN to get things going, as much as I can.

## Fixes
- Fixed a lot of minor bugs. There are literally so many that I can't remember them.
- Major performance improvement (fixes around 70% of the lag)

#### Reminder: You can use Pets instead of Venting / Shapeshifting for some roles. You can turn on this option under the Game Modifiers tab, where Guesser Mode is also located.

## New Roles and Settings
- New Role: Camera Man (Crewmate)
- New Role: Magician (Neutral)
- New Role: Reckless (Neutral)
- New Role: Postman (Neutral)
- New Role: Sapper (Impostor)
- New Role: Weapon Master (Neutral)
- 2 new settings for Crewpostor: Lunge on kills & number of task completions required to make 1 kill
- New setting for Merchant: Can only add-ons that are enabled in the settings

### Notes
- I'm sorry if something doesn't work. My time to test the code I add is next to 0, and I work alone on all of this. Still, I hope there aren't any major bugs and this brings you a good experience.
- Thank you for reading this and using my mod. Support and feedback is what motivates me to keep developing.
