## Thank you for using EHR!

## Fixes
- Fixed and updated incorrect and missing strings
- A lot of roles have minor fixes, I don't remember all of them
- More performance improvement

### Major setting: Use Pet button instead of Vent / SS
- This setting applies to all venting crew roles and shapeshifting impostor roles that only use the extra ability as a trigger.
- Petting your pet is not visible to anyone else if you only do it once.
- When this setting is active, cooldowns show next to the player's role text.
- Everyone gets the Pusheen pet at the start of the game if this setting is on.
- This is just way more convenient. You can use your Pet button anytime, without anyone knowing.
- You can leave this setting off and the mod will work as it used to before this!
- The setting is located in Game Settings -> Different.

## New Roles and Settings
- New Role: Hacker (Crewmate)
- New Role: Mastermind (Impostor)
- New Role: Gambler (Impostor)
- New Role: Hitman (Impostor)
- New Role: Rift Maker (Impostor)

### Notes
- I'm sorry if something doesn't work. My time to test the code I add is next to 0, and I work alone on all of this. Still, I hope there aren't any major bugs and this brings you a good experience.
- Thank you for reading this.
