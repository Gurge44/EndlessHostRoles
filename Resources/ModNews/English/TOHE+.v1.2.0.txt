#-----------------------------

## Thank you for using TOHE+!

## Fixes
- This version is fully compatible with the new and loved Fungle map!
- Updated all roles to work on Fungle
- Other minor fixes

#### Reminder: You can use Pets instead of Venting / Shapeshifting for some roles. You can turn on this option under the Game Modifiers tab, where Guesser Mode is also located.

## New Setting
- You can now change the sabotage time limit on Mira HQ (both Reactor and O2)

### Notes
- I'm sorry if something doesn't work. My time to test the code I add is next to 0, and I work alone on all of this. Still, I hope there aren't any major bugs and this brings you a good experience.
- Thank you for reading this and using my mod. Support and feedback is what motivates me to keep developing.
