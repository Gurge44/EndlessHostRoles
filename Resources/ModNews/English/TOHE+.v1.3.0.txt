## Additions and Improvements
- Optimized FFA code
- Ported PlagueDoctor (Curse), Stealth and Penguin from TOH
- Added some hackers to the EAC list
- Added a setting to disable the spore triggers on Fungle
- You can now customize the time limit for all critical sabotages (+ the mushroom mixup sabotage duration as well)
- Added a setting to disable the Zipline on Fungle
- Added a setting to customize the Zipline travel time, both from top to bottom and from bottom to top
- New setting for Cursed Soul: Soulless Players Win With the Cursed Soul (boolean)
- New settings for Puppeteer: Kill Cooldown, Puppet Cooldown, Delay before the puppeted player kills
- Puppeteer can now kill using the double click method
- Improved the code for multiple roles
- Role summary in the chat looks a lot better now (it's colored with a black outline)

## Major changes
- Roles that use shapeshifting only as a target selector or a trigger will no longer perform the transformation, the shapeshift is canceled automatically after selecting the target! There's also a new setting to disable ALL egg animations.

- Added more support for non-host modded clients (we use a lot more RPCs now, so if this update leads you to more disconnects or glitches, please report it to me and I'll make a setting to turn it off)
Note: Some roles are still buggy for non-host modded clients. If you want a fully functioning experience, join lobbies with a vanilla client (you can use the Switch Vanilla option in the settings) (FFA is fully compatible with non-host modded clients :D)


### Notes
- I'm sorry if something doesn't work. My time to test the code I add is next to 0, and I work alone on all of this. Still, I hope there aren't any major bugs and this brings you a good experience.
- Thank you for reading this and using my mod. Support and feedback is what motivates me to keep developing.

P.S. I take no responsibility for Penguin, Stealth and PlagueDoctor (aka Curse) if they don't work :D
