help:<size=110%><b><color=#ffc0cb>TOWN OF HOST EDITED PLUS</color>\nQUICK GUIDE<size=50%>\n(Guide by <color=#b700ff>@fluxwux</color> on Discord)\n<size=30%>Take notes, class.\n\n<size=80%>EHR is a pretty complicated mod, but don't worry! I'm here to teach you all the basics of the game so you can become the best player there is! First off, let's start with the most integral part of the mod...\n\n<size=100%><color=#4dff00>ROLES</color>\n<size=80%></b>Each player will be assigned a role at the start of the game. There are 4 role types. <b><color=#ff1919>Impostor</color>, <color=#8cffff>Crewmate</color>, <color=#ffab1b>Neutral</color>, & <color=#ff9ace>Add-Ons</color></b><size=70%>.\n\n<size=80%><b><color=#ff1919>Impostors</color> & <color=#8cffff>Crewmates</b>\n<size=60%></color>Self explanatory. These roles are given to the impostors or crewmates.\n\n<b><size=80%><color=#ffab1b>Neutrals</color></b>\n<size=60%><b>This isn't a team. These roles are for any roles that don't side with the impostors or crewmates.</b> Usually, they work alone toward a goal, depending on what their role does. that goal can range from getting their target voted out to win alone, killing everyone in the game, simply staying alive until the end to win with the winning team, and more.\n\n<size=80%><b><color=#ff9ace>Add-Ons</color><size=60%>\nAdd-Ons are roles that you can get on top of your team role.</b>Usually, they provide minor benefits, such as your killer automatically self-reporting your body, giving you a red screen flash when a body dies, and more. Some are even major additions, like being able to kill people after your death. <b>But be weary, as you may be assigned a harmful Add-On!</b>These roles may give you reduced vision, an inability to report bodies, an inability to fix sabotages, and more. <b>Remember that most (not all) Add-Ons are not team specific</b>, and can be assigned to anyone unless the host individually choses which roles go on what.\n\n<size=85%><b>It is important to remember that nobody should reveal their role unless they have a reason to <size=75%>(eg. Snitch finishing their tasks to out the impostors)\n\n<size=100%><color=#204d42>CHAT COMMANDS\n<size=80%></b>Chat commands</color> are a very useful asset, and each one has its own very useful effect. Examples of some meeting commands can be found below <b>vvvv\n\n<size=73%>/m:</b> Explains your role and Add-On(s) in detail. <b>A MUST USE</b> if you don't know what your role does.\n<b>/r [nome da função]:</b> Shows you what any role in the game does. Just type in the role. Typing /r on its own shows every role enabled in the host's settings.\n<b>/kcount (can be disabled by host):</b> Displays the amount of impostors and neutral killers remaining.\n<b>/l (not i, L):</b> Used in the lobby to show the results of the previous game. Displays who died to whom, everyone's roles, and who won the last game. Usually, hosts will make this message appear automatically after the round ends.\n\n<size=100%><b><color=#f8cd46>GUESSING<size=80%></b>\nGuessing</color>, or variants of guessing, are abilities that can be used by a select few roles. Usually, they involve <b>guessing a certain player's role</b> in order to kill them during a meeting, or achieve other effects. Sometimes, hosts will make it so entire teams or even all players can guess.\n\n<size=90%><b>HOW TO <color=#f8cd46>GUESS</color>\n<size=60%></b>This guide will show the most common way to guess using the /bt command.\n\n<size=80%><b>#1. Figure out the player's role\n<size=60%></b>Before you can guess, you need to find out what their role is. If you've found out what their role is, you can guess them in the next meeting. For example, I know blue is the Snitch, so moving on to step 2...\n\n<size=80%><b>#2. Type /id\n<size=60%></b>Typing /id will show a list of everyone and their respective ID, represented by a number from 1-15. I type /id and blue's ID is 7. Sometimes, you may already see the IDs of all players without having to type this command. Now all that's left is...\n\n<b><size=80%>#3. Type /bt [player ID] [role}\n<size=60%></b>In my case, it would be /bt 7 snitch. Now, if correct, I have killed blue, and now blue will have to wallow in their shame as a ghost. How sad. But if I misguess, I have to wallow in my shame as I die if I guess wrong. How embarrasing.\n\n<size=80%><b>Now, you should be caught up on all things EHR related. Now go out there and win some games!
