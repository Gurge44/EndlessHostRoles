The Warlock may freeze in place for a few seconds after killing via cursed player.",
  "ZombieInfoLong": "(Impostors):\\nZombie has a short kill cooldown but moves very slowly and has very little vision. Zombie will not be voted out by anyone other than the Dictator, and the movement speed of Zombie will gradually slow down as they make kills or time passes.",

The Ninja can then use the vanish/pet to teleport to the marked person and kill the marked person. Ninja cannot kill regularly, but may be able to kill regularly after assassination according to the host's settings.",
  "HackerInfoLong": "(Impostors):\\nAnonymous can use Shapeshift to hack into a target. The hacked target will report the body killed by Anonymous or its own if there is none. Hacking ignores whether a body can be reported. Hacking Lazy Guy is a waste of time.",

  "SniperInfoLong": "(Impostors):\\nIf you want to shoot players from a distance, you'll need to follow these steps. First, you must shapeshift or pet twice to make a successful snipe. Once you've done that, imagine an arrow pointing from your first shapeshift or petting location to your unshift or second petting location. That arrow will show you the direction in which the snipe will be made. Remember that the snipe only kills the first person in its path. Also, you won't be able to kill anyone normally until you use up all of your ammo.",

  "BoobyTrapInfoLong": "(Impostors):\\nIn the game, the Trapster kills a player and then puts a trap on their body. If another player reports the dead body and it has the Trapster's trap on it, the player who reports will die instantly without the body getting reported. The player killed by the Trapster's trap will also become a Trapster. This chain reaction continues until no more players are left to become Trapsters.

  "BallLightningInfoLong": "(Impostors):\\nThe Lightning role cannot make regular kills. When the Lightning uses its kill button, the target will vaporize into a quantum ghost. If a player who is not a quantum ghost touches the quantum ghost, the quantum ghost will die. If the quantum ghost survives until a meeting, they will die after the meeting ends. Interacting with the quantum ghost has no effect. Killing the Lightning may cause the killer to vaporize into a quantum ghost, depending on the host's settings.",
  "GreedierInfoLong": "(Impostors):\\nAs the Greedy, your kill cooldown is different after every even-numbered kill and every odd-numbered kill of yours. You have a separate cooldown after meetings.

Additionally, they can store a bullet, and upon successful storage, a shield animation will appear on their body as a reminder.

At the beginning of each meeting, the Quick Shooter can only keep a certain number of bullets, which the host sets.",
  "CamouflagerInfoLong": "(Impostors):\\nDuring the use of the Shapeshift skill by Camouflager, all players will appear identical. This effect will last until Camouflager reverts to its original form. It's important to note that the skills of communication sabotage camouflage and the skills of Camouflager can be used together. However, in case a meeting takes place during the activation of Camouflager's skill, it will be considered invalid.",
  "EraserInfoLong": "(Impostors):\\nDuring the meeting, Eraser can vote for any crew member as a target. The selected crew member's roles will be erased after the meeting concludes. It is important to note that players whose roles have been erased will always be considered as vanilla roles, including the game result page.",
  "OverKillerInfoLong": "(Impostors):\\nIt can be difficult to identify other dead bodies when reporting a Butcher kill, as there may be multiple dead bodies on the targets. This is due to the implementation principle, which requires the killed target to repeatedly display the animation of being killed and prevents them from participating in the meeting normally during this period. Additionally, if the Butcher kills the Avenger, the Avenger will seek revenge on everyone in anger.",
  "HangmanInfoLong": "(Impostors):\\nThe Hangman kills by strangling during shapeshifting, ignoring all target abilities. The strangled player doesn't leave a body or trigger abilities, including Veteran, Lucky, and Seer. Additional roles are also affected.",

  "DevourerInfoLong": "(Impostors):\\nAs the Devourer, you use your shapeshift to change the appearance of the target of the shapeshift permanently. Additionally, when each player's appearance changes, your kill cooldown is reduced by a defined number of seconds. If the Devourer dies or gets voted out during a meeting, the player's appearance will change back to their normal appearance.",
  "MorphlingInfoLong": "(Impostors):\\nAs the Morphling, you are a Shapeshifter but cannot kill while not shapeshifted.",
  "TwisterInfoLong": "(Impostors):\\nAs the Twister, you can use shapeshifting/petting to swap the position of all players randomly.\\n\\nThe Twister itself will not swap places with anyone, and players who are in vents cannot be teleported.",

  "ModeDescribe.TheMindGame": "The Mind Game is a 4-round elimination game focused on strategy, bluffing, and item use. Players compete for points across rounds, with only one emerging victorious.\\nRound 1: Demand Points - Pick a number. If someone else picks the same, both get nothing. Reach the point goal first to advance. Lowest scorers in each group are eliminated.\\nRound 2: Super Point Auctions - Bid normal points in hidden auctions for super points. Highest bidders win. Lowest super point holders are eliminated.\\nRound 2.5: Merchant Intermission - Spend super points on powerful items. Items can blind, block, steal, or enhance. Use commands to buy and activate them.\\nRound 3: Demand + Items - Same as Round 1, but items are active. Everyone plays together. Lowest scorers are eliminated until only a few remain.\\nRound 4: The Briefcase Game - One player holds the winning briefcase. Get ejected while holding it to lock in placement. Briefcases shuffle after each ejection. If only 2 remain, the briefcase holder loses. Use Lasso to steal.\\nFinal Scoring: Total score = points from rounds + super points bonus + placement bonus. Highest total wins.",
