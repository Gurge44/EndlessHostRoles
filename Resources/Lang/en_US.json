When you finish all your tasks, you get new tasks, but you don't have to do them for task win. You don't know how much alcohol you have at the time. You only see warning when your alcohol level is low. Alcohol is counted in ‰.\\n\\nYou also have some abilities that are unlocked if you have enough alcohol. To use ability, switch between them using pet button and use selected one by venting:\\n<size=70%>- Going for milk: You go for milk. When you use it, you get teleported outside the map. You also can't discuss or vote in meetings. You can do nothing. You will come back with milk after exactly 10 years. When you come back, crewmates instantly win. When you use it, everyone will be informed about it.\\n- Super vision: You will have max vision for some time.\\n- Sniffing: You get arrows pointing to existing dead bodies after using it. Arrows only update when you sniff again.\\n- Sleep: During sleep people can't interact with you, but you can't see or move. During sleep you also cannot use any abilities and your alcohol is stable. You wake up when a meeting starts.\\n- Rage: You kill next person you see.\\n- Giving drink: You give all nearby players a drink.
