# Thank you so much for finding and using EHR!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> InnerSloth added a way to use chat commands without needing to spam the chat after it to hide who typed it. In the next few weeks, please adapt to using commands with a `/cmd ` prefix. So if you were to type `/bt 4 snitch`, you would now type `/cmd bt 4 snitch`. This is the last major version of EHR that allows the old way of typing commands. Starting v7.3.0, the mod will NOT spam the chat even if you don't use /cmd.

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed Mingle end summary for non-host modded clients
- Fixed `Chat During Game` causing black screen for vanilla clients in Mingle, Quiz and Natural Disasters
