# Thank you so much for finding and using EHR!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> InnerSloth added a way to use chat commands without needing to spam the chat after it to hide who typed it. In the next few weeks, please adapt to using commands with a `/cmd ` prefix. So if you were to type `/bt 4 snitch`, you would now type `/cmd bt 4 snitch`. This is the last major version of EHR that allows the old way of typing commands. Starting v7.3.0, the mod will NOT spam the chat even if you don't use /cmd.

## Bug Fixes
- **Fixed chat commands sometimes not working when using the 'cmd' prefix**
- Fixed an error that caused CNOs to not re-appear after meetings
- Fixed some roles appearing in draft choices when they shouldn't

## Changes
- New welcome template message
- Regular numbers in chat messages are now replaced to full-width unicode numbers to bypass InnerSloth's digit limit (they could've just used char.IsDigit but oh well)
